# Twitter Mining
This project contains python code for twitter mining.

## Goal
My goal is to find novel ways to find what is important to me on twitter and 
to play with cool tech.

## Dependencies
- CouchDB
- tweepy

## To run
1. Run filter_tweets_streaming_api.py to load tweets to couchdb.  
2. Run a "reporting" script such as top_tweeters_by_follower_count.py.
3. That's all for now...
